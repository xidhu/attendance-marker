Not familiar with how to create Chrome extensions? [Click here to read the documentation](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/index.html).

## Using in your Chrome browser
Open Google Meet.

* Open our extension.
* Take attendance that students typed in ChatBox whenever you wanted.

**formatting**
eg:

    // used to format the input %d indicates integer.
    roll no %d => roll no 45
    %d		   => 45
    rn%d	   => rn45
    


## Loading your version in Chrome

* Go To `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
* Check the `Developer Mode` checkbox.
* Click the button that says `Load unpacked extension...`.
* Choose the location of your code.
